Project 1 is a very basic, very silly CRUD system. 
Ruby on rails. 
---
I spent some time creating associations, but mostly had to minimise scope for the project while establishing foundations to add to the project at a later date. 

I struggled throughout the process, but there were some rewarding aspects in the latter stages of the project. Big thanks to Zoom helpers, and special shout out to Mandy who helped me solve a problem by suggesting i use @post to manipulate css depending on mood id in the url.

I had some success with following and implementing docs such as Bootstrap and Rails guide docs. I looked a lot at Joel's TUNR code for setting up the users. Massive thank you to Hugh who was very encouraging and helpful when I was particularly melodramatic. 

I basically aimed to achieve a basic crud. Once that was achieved I felt more comfortable going at a slower pace to explore and experiment with my code. I think I repeated myself less in this code compared to the first project.
